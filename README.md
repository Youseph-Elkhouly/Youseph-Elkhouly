## 🧠 About Me

I build things with code and consistency.  
Gym 6 days a week.  
Projects whenever inspiration strikes.  
Ideas always welcome.

From sprinting up hills to sprinting on sprints,  
I balance my life between **software** and **self-growth**.  
Whether it's launching a new app or chasing a new personal best,  
I'm driven by momentum and purpose.
