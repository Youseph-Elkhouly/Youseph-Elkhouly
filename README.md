# Hey, I'm Youseph 👋

> *“Write clean code. Lift heavy. Think big.”*

I'm a Computer Science student @ University of Guelph, passionate about full-stack development, creative tech, and building ideas that make people say *“Woah, that’s smart.”*

- 🧠 I love working on side projects — anything from AI hacks to startup prototypes.
- 🏋️ I train at the gym 6 days a week — discipline off the keyboard matters.
- 🏃‍♂️ I go for runs, play sports, and breathe competition.
- 💡 I’m always building something. If I’m not, I’m thinking about what to build next.
