# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Youseph

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Guelph who codes with intention and trains with discipline.

I love:
- Going to the gym (6 days a week, no excuses)
- Building cool ideas and turning them into real projects
- Playing sports, going for runs, and always pushing myself mentally & physically
- Creating, learning, iterating

If Iâ€™m not shipping code, Iâ€™m probably lifting, sprinting, or planning something big.
